# speed_predict
Speed prediction for intersection Green and Plymouth Rd

This algorithm adopts Encoder-Decoder sequence to sequence mode (seq2seq). Seq2seq is widely used in natural language processing (NLP) for machine translation, text summarization, conversational modeling, image captioning, and more. We are inspired by language model and modified seq2seq for vehicle velocity prediction. Velocity prediction and language translation have the common feature that using the time-series data as the input, extract the hidden state, and output another time-series data.
